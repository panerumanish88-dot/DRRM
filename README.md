🚨 Disaster Relief Command Center
Full-Stack Web Application: Express.js + In-Memory DB (MongoDB-ready) + Vanilla JavaScript + Leaflet.js

A data-driven disaster relief resource allocation and route optimization system that helps NGOs and authorities prioritize affected locations, allocate limited resources efficiently, and compute optimal delivery routes during emergencies.

v1.1 Update: Now includes a fully interactive Network Overview Map powered by Leaflet.js — showing relief centers, affected areas, and road connections (including blocked roads) live on a real map.

Node ID Convention
Centers use their raw IDs (1, 2, 3...). Areas are stored in the routing graph as area.id + 1000 (e.g. area #1 → node 1001). This prevents ID collisions when both types share the same graph — used consistently across database.js, routingEngine.js, and the frontend map.

📦 Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js v18+ → nodejs.org
npm (bundled with Node.js)
A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)
Internet connection (for OpenStreetMap tiles in the map)
Step 1 — Install Backend Dependencies
cd dssrCopy/backend
npm install
Step 2 — Configure Environment (Optional)
Create a .env file inside backend/:

PORT=3000
# Optional — only needed if upgrading to real MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/disaster-relief
The server defaults to port 3000 if no .env is present.

Step 3 — Start the Backend Server
# Standard start
node server.js

# Auto-restart on file changes (recommended during development)
npm run dev
Expected output:

🚨 Disaster Relief API running on port 3000
📍 Access API at: http://localhost:3000
📊 Health check: http://localhost:3000/
Step 4 — Open the Frontend
# Option A: Open the file directly in your browser
open dssrCopy/frontend/index.html

# Option B: Serve with a local HTTP server (avoids any file:// CORS quirks)
cd dssrCopy/frontend
npx serve .
⚠️ Always start the backend BEFORE opening the frontend. The page loads all data on startup. If the backend is not running, the map will show zeros. Click Refresh Map after starting the backend to reload.

🚀 Usage
Basic Workflow
1. Dashboard & Map

Open the app — the Network Overview Map loads automatically
Green dots = relief centers, coloured dots = affected areas, lines = roads
One dashed red line is visible by default (Road #7 is blocked in sample data)
2. Compute Priorities

Click the Priority Scoring tab
Click "Calculate All Priorities"
Areas are ranked by urgency score; map markers update colour instantly:
🔴 Red = High priority (score ≥ 0.7) — animated pulse ring
🟠 Orange = Medium priority (score ≥ 0.4)
🔵 Blue = Low priority (score < 0.4)
3. Plan a Route

Click the Route Planning tab
Select a relief center and an affected area
Optionally check "Optimize by Time" instead of distance
Click "Find Shortest Route" — the path is shown as a visual node chain
4. Multi-Stop Route

On the same tab, use the right panel to select multiple areas
Click "Plan Multi-Stop Route" — uses nearest-neighbour TSP heuristic
5. Add New Data

Click the Resource Management tab
Fill in any of the three forms (Add Center / Add Area / Add Road)
New entries appear in the dashboard lists and on the map immediately
6. What-If Simulation

Click the What-If Analysis tab
Select a road and choose Block or Unblock
Click "Run Simulation" — see how priorities would change without saving
The map updates to show the simulated road status
Sample Scenario (Built-in Data)
Entity	Details
Central Relief Hub	Lat 27.1767, Lng 78.0081 · 1000 food, 2000 water, 500 medical
North District Warehouse	Lat 27.25, Lng 78.10 · 800 food, 1500 water, 400 medical
Flood Zone A	Severity 5, 250 people, Difficult access
Village Beta	Severity 3, 150 people, Easy access
Landslide Area C	Severity 4, 400 people, Difficult access
Road #7	Village Beta ↔ Landslide Area C — BLOCKED by default
🗺️ Network Overview Map
The map is the centrepiece of the Dashboard tab. Here is how it works technically.

Initialisation
Leaflet is loaded from a CDN — no npm install required:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/1.9.4/leaflet.min.css"/>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/1.9.4/leaflet.min.js"></script>
Layer System
Three independent L.layerGroup() instances allow toggling:

Layer	Contents	Style
centerLayer	Relief center markers	Green static circles
areaLayer	Affected area markers	Red/Orange/Blue by priority; pulse ring on high
routeLayer	Road polylines	Blue solid (open), Red dashed (blocked)
Correct Loading Order
Roads need coordinates to draw lines. The loading sequence is enforced with await:

async function loadAllData() {
  await loadCenters();  // populates locCoords for center IDs
  await loadAreas();    // populates locCoords for area IDs (id+1000)
  await loadRoads();    // all coordinates ready — road lines draw correctly
}
Tab Switch Fix
When the Dashboard tab is hidden, Leaflet cannot measure the container. On re-activation:

if (targetTab === 'dashboard' && networkMap) {
  setTimeout(() => networkMap.invalidateSize(), 50);
}

🧮 Algorithms
1. Priority Scoring
Formula:

P = 0.5 × (severity / 5)  +  0.3 × (people / max_people)  +  0.2 × access_difficulty
Component	Weight	Rationale
Severity	50%	Directly reflects immediate danger to life
Population (normalised)	30%	More people = greater total need
Access Difficulty	20%	Hard-to-reach areas may need priority scheduling
Example — Flood Zone A:

severity     = 5   → S_norm = 5/5   = 1.0
people       = 250 → N_norm = 250/400 = 0.625   (max is Landslide Area C with 400)
access       = 1   (difficult)

P = 0.5(1.0) + 0.3(0.625) + 0.2(1)
  = 0.5 + 0.1875 + 0.2
  = 0.8875  → HIGH PRIORITY (red marker, pulse animation)
Time complexity: O(n log n) — one pass to find max, then sort

2. Dijkstra's Shortest Path
Purpose: Find optimal route from a relief center to an affected area.

Steps:

Initialise all node distances to ∞; source node distance = 0
Add all nodes to an unvisited set
Pick the unvisited node with the smallest known distance
For each neighbour, compute tentative distance (current + edge weight)
If tentative < stored, update it and record the predecessor
Mark current node as visited; stop if it is the destination
Reconstruct path by backtracking through the predecessor map
Key details:

Nodes = all relief centers + all affected areas
Edges = road connections (blocked roads are excluded entirely from the graph)
Edge weight = distance_km or travel_time_minutes depending on useTime flag
Time complexity: O(V²) with Set — sufficient for small networks; upgradeable to O((V+E) log V) with a binary heap
3. Multi-Stop Routing (TSP Nearest-Neighbour)
Finding the exact shortest route visiting N areas is NP-hard (Travelling Salesman Problem). The nearest-neighbour heuristic gives a good approximation in polynomial time:

Start at the relief center
Run Dijkstra to every unvisited area; pick the nearest
Move there, mark visited
Repeat until all areas are visited
Return to the starting center
Quality: Typically within 20–25% of optimal. For 3–10 areas (typical disaster scenario) this is excellent performance with near-instant computation.

Time complexity: O(N²) where N = number of selected areas

4. Resource Allocation
Proportional distribution when supply cannot fully meet demand:

ratio = min(totalAvailable / totalRequired, 1.0)  // per resource type
allocation = Math.floor(area.required × ratio)
If supply ≥ demand, ratio = 1.0 and all needs are fully met. If supply < demand, every area gets the same proportional share.

🐛 Troubleshooting
Symptom	Cause	Fix
Map shows 0 for all counts	Frontend loaded before backend started	Start backend first; click Refresh Map
Map is blank / no tiles	No internet connection	OpenStreetMap tiles require internet access
CORS error in browser console	Backend not running or wrong port	Verify server is on port 3000; check API_URL in app.js
Route says "No route found"	All paths between nodes are blocked	Unblock a road or add an alternative connection
Priority scores are all 0	Priorities not computed yet	Click "Calculate All Priorities" on Priority Scoring tab
Map looks wrong after tab switch	Leaflet cannot measure hidden container	Already fixed — invalidateSize() fires on tab activation
"Module not found" on start	Dependencies not installed	Run cd backend && npm install
Port 3000 already in use	Another process using the port	Change PORT=3001 in .env and update API_URL in app.js
